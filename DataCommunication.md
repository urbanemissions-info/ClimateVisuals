## Caution reporting relative risk

Say the percentage of people who suffer from respiratory diseases due to air pollution increases from 6% to 7%. This can be easily reported by the media that there is a 16% increase in the risk of respiratory diseases due to air pollution. `(7-6/6 * 100)`. Always report absolute risks.

## Positive and Negative Framing

A city can report that 80% of its people breathe clean air or 20% of its people breathe polluted air every day. Same data, but the framing of it evokes different emotions and encourages different kind of actions.
